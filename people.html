                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>My passion for cancer research prompted me to apply for a doctoral degree at the Sree Chita
                        Tirunal
                        Institute for Medical Science and Technology, which I began in 2006. To pursue my long-held
                        dream of
                        being an independent researcher, it is unavoidable that I strengthen my scientific,
                        technological,
                        and management skills. The Edwin L. Steele Laboratory for Tumor Biology at Massachusetts General
                        Hospital, Harvard Medical School, provided the ideal environment for those abilities to develop.
                        In
                        order to join the Steele Lab, I applied for an Indian fellowship and was awarded for it by the
                        Indo-US Science and Technology Forum. I subsequently joined the Steele Lab in November 2013 and
                        started working on a project that looked into the relationship between nitric oxide and vessel
                        normalisation. This helped me comprehend angiogenesis and prompted me to explore the role of
                        immune
                        suppression in immune cell recruitment and phenotype, as well as subsequent angiogenesis. As a
                        result, my current objective is to study more about the mechanisms underpinning
                        immunosuppression,
                        specifically the role of angiogenic/chemokine molecules in the creation of aberrant vasculature
                        and
                        therapy resistance in normal and obese patients. Following that, we established the Centre For
                        Tumour Immunology and Microenvironment Laboratory at Mar Ivanios College, and we received
                        funding
                        for two separate projects submitted to the Kerala Government's Kairali Gvaeshnapuaskaram in 2021
                        and
                        the Department of Science and Technology's Teachers Associateship for Research Excellence in
                        2022,
                        respectively. My laboratory's ultimate goal is to make a difference in the lives of cancer
                        patients.
